# Clipboard text support for PowerShell Core (cross-platform) and Windows PowerShell v2-v4

`ClipboardText` is a **cross-edition, cross-platform PowerShell module** that provides support
for **copying text to and retrieving text from the system clipboard**, via the `Set-ClipboardText` and `Get-ClipboardText` cmdlets.

It is useful in the following **scenarios**:

* **Use with PowerShell _Core_ on (hopefully) all supported platforms.**

  * As of v6.1, PowerShell Core doesn't ship with clipboard cmdlets.
  * This module fills this gap, albeit only with respect to _text_.  
  * The implementation relies on external utilities (command-line programs) on all supported platforms:
    * Windows: `clip.exe` (built in)
    * macOS: `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` (built in)
    * Linux: [`xclip`](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) (_requires installation_ via the system's package manager; e.g. `sudo apt-get install xclip`; available on X11-based [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/)-compliant desktops, such as on Ubuntu)

* **Use with _older versions_ of _Windows PowerShell_.**

  * Only since v5.0 does Windows PowerShell ship with `Set-Clipboard` and `Get-Clipboard` cmdlets.
  * This module fills the gap for v2-v4, albeit only with respect to _text_.  
  * For implementing backward-compatible functionality, you may also use this module in v5+, in which case this module's cmdlets call the built-in ones behind the scenes.
  * On older versions, the implementation uses [Windows Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms) .NET types behind the scenes (namespace `System.Windows.Forms`)

* **Use in _universal scripts_.**
  * Universal scripts are scripts that run on both Windows PowerShell and Powershell Core, on all supported platforms, including older versions of Windows PowerShell; in this case, down to version 2.

# Installation

## Installation from the PowerShell Gallery

**Prerequisite**: The `PowerShellGet` module must be installed (verify with `Get-Command Install-Module`).  
`PowerShellGet` comes with PowerShell version 5 or higher, but is also available as a download for versions 3 and 4 - see [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/gallery/installing-psget).

* Current-user-only installation:

```powershell
# Installation for the current user only.
PS> Install-Module ClipboardText -Scope CurrentUser
```

* All-users installation (requires elevation / `sudo`):

```powershell
# Installation for ALL users.
# IMPORTANT: Requires an ELEVATED session:
#   On Windows: 
#     Right-click on the Windows PowerShell icon and select "Run as Administrator".
#   On Linux and macOS:
#     Run `sudo pwsh` from an existing terminal.
ELEV-PS> Install-Module ClipboardText
```

## Manual Installation

If you're still using PowerShell v2, manual installation is your only option.

Clone this repository (as a subfolder) into one of the directories listed in the `$env:PSModulePath` variable; e.g., to install the module in the context of the current user, choose the following parent folders:

* **Windows**:
  * Windows PowerShell: `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`
  * PowerShell Core: `$HOME\Documents\PowerShell\Modules`
* **macOs, Linux** (PowerShell Core): 
  * `$HOME/.local/share/powershell/Modules`

As long as you've cloned into one of the directories listed in the `$env:PSModulePath` variable - copying to some of which requires elevation / `sudo` - and as long your `$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference` is not set (the default) or set to `All`, calling `Set-ClipboardText` or `Get-ClipboardText` should import the module on demand - except in _PowerShell v2_.

To explicitly import the module, run `Import-Module <path/to/module-folder>`.

**Example**: Install as a current-user-only module:

Note: Assumes that [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) is installed.

```powershell
# Switch to the parent directory of the current user's modules.
Set-Location $(if ($env:OS -eq 'Windows_NT') { "$HOME\Documents\{0}\Modules" -f ('WindowsPowerShell', 'PowerShell')[[bool]$IsCoreClr] } else { "$HOME/.local/share/powershell/Modules" })
# Clone this repo into subdir. 'ClipboardText'; --depth 1 gets only the latest revision.
git clone --depth 1 --quiet https://github.com/mklement0/ClipboardText
```

On _Windows PowerShell v2_, you must now explicitly load the module:

```powershell
Import-Module -Verbose .\ClipboardText
```

Run `Set-ClipboardText -?` to verify that installation succeeded and that the module is loaded on demand (PSv3+):
you should see brief CLI help text.

# Usage

In short:

* `Set-ClipboardText` copies strings as-is; output from commands is copied using the same representation you see in the console, essentially obtained via `Out-String`; e.g.:

```powershell
# Copy the full path of the current filesystem location to the clipbard:
$PWD.Path | Set-ClipboardText

# Copy the names of all files in the current directory to the clipboard:
Get-ChildItem -File -Name | Set-ClipboardText
```

* `Get-ClipboardText` retrieves text from the clipboard as an _array of lines_ by default; use `-Raw` to request the text as-is, as a potentially multi-line string.

```powershell
# Retrieve text from the clipboard as a single string and save it to a file:
Get-ClipboardText -Raw > out.txt

# Retrieve text from the clipboard as an array of lines and prefix each with
# a line number:
Get-ClipboardText | ForEach-Object { $i=0 } { '#{0}: {1}' -f (++$i), $_ }
```

For more, consult the **built-in help** after installation:

```powershell
# Concise command-line help with terse description and syntax diagram.
Get-ClipboardText -?
Set-ClipboardText -?

# Full help, including parameter descriptions and details and examples.
Get-Help -Full Get-ClipboardText
Get-Help -Full Set-ClipboardText

# Examples only
Get-Help -Examples Get-ClipboardText
Get-Help -Examples Set-ClipboardText
```
